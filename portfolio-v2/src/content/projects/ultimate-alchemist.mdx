## Overview

This project was my most ambitious foray into **combinatorial logic**. I wanted to create a system where players didn't just "click a button" to make a potion.

## Features

- **Ingredient Combinations**: Players can mix different ingredients to create unique potions, each with its own effects.
- **Dynamic Effects**: The effects of the potions are determined by the specific combination of ingredients, leading to a vast array of possibilities.
- **Economy System**: Players can buy ingredients, stations, and relics and sell potions to customers. Shop items are restocked every 5 minutes and availability varies by rarity.
- **Leaderboard**: A competitive aspect where players can see who has created the most expensive or unique potions.
- **Base Building**: Players can build and customize their own plots to increase production via stations and relics.
- **QA testing and Feedback**: Regular playtesting sessions to gather feedback and make iterative improvements from QA Central.
- **Trello Board**: Used for project management and tracking progress.

## Sample Mechanics

```lua
function mixIngredients(a, b)

end
```

## Challenges

- **Balancing Complexity**: With so many possible combinations, it was a challenge to ensure that the system remained intuitive and fun.

## Lesssons Learned

- **Iterative Design**: The importance of playtesting and iterating based on feedback to refine the mechanics and balance.
