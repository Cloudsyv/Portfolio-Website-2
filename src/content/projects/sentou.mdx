## Overview

Sentou is a combat system built on Roblox that features various weapons, skills, and pvp mechanics. The project was a collaboration between myself and Krys Hutchinson, who handled the modeling aspect of the game. The combat system is designed to be fast-paced and skill-based, with a focus on player-versus-player (pvp) combat.

## Features

- **Variety of Weapons (15+)**: Sentou features a wide range of weapons grouped by the weight of the weapon, each with its own unique playstyle and mechanics.
  - **Fists**: Unique playstyle focused on close-range combat and high mobility, with a mix of quick strikes and powerful combos. (Fists, Brass Knuckles, Claws, Gauntlets)
  - **Light**: Extremely fast but fragile, with quick attacks and high mobility. (Dagger, Rapier, Nunchucks)
  - **Medium**: Fast and versatile, with quick attacks and combos. (Katana, Spear, Straight Swords)
  - **Heavy**: Slow but powerful, with heavy attacks that can break through defenses. (Greatsword, Warhammer, Great Axe)
- **Skill System**: Players can equip various skills that complement their weapons and playstyle, allowing for deep customization and strategy.
- **PVP Mechanics**: The combat system is designed with pvp in mind, featuring mechanics like blocking, parrying, dodging, block breaking, unique melee attacks, and a stamina bar to create a dynamic and engaging combat experience.
- **Progression System**: Players can level up their stats and skills to become stronger and unlock new abilities, creating a sense of progression and growth.
  - **Stat system (10+)**: 9 main stats (Strength, Endurance, Attack Speed, Dexterity, Stamina, etc) that players can increase and 7 hidden stats that depend on player's equipment and skills (Weight, Armor Resistance, Life Steal, Critical Chance, etc).

## Challenges

- **Balancing**: With such a wide variety of weapons, skills, and stats, balancing the combat system was a major challenge. We had to ensure that no single weapon or skill was too overpowered or underpowered, and that there were viable options for different playstyles.
- **PVP Mechanics**: Designing a combat system that is engaging and skill-based for pvp combat, while also being unique in it's own right.
- **Quantity of Content**: Creating a large variety of weapons, skills, and stats to provide players with meaningful choices and customization options, while also ensuring that each one is well-designed and balanced.
