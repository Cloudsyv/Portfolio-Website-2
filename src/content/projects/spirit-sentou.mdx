## Overview

Spirit Sentou is a combat system built on Roblox that features various weapons, skills, and pvp mechanics. The project was a collaboration between myself, Krys Hutchinson (modeling), and Luis Hernandez (building). The combat system is designed to be fast-paced and skill-based, with a focus on player-versus-player (pvp) combat.

## Features

- **Basic Combat** - Blocking, Parrying, Dodging, Stamina, Melee attacks (M1), and Heavy attacks (M2).
- **Advanced Character Customization** - Players can customize their characters with 3D clothing, hair models, and faces; allowing for a unique and personalized gaming experience. (Modeled by Krys Hutchinson)
- **Discord Integration** - Important game notifications are sent to a dedicated Discord channel, keeping players informed and engaged with the game community.
- **Progression System** - Players can level up their stats (Strength, Endurance, and Agility) through training to become stronger and unlock new abilities (Barrages, Smashes), creating a sense of progression and growth.
