## Overview

Card Project is a passion project where I attempted to recreate the popular game "Slay the spire" in a 3D environment on Roblox. Majority of the mechanics are influenced from my observations of "Slay the spire" and "Arcane lineage".

Sound effects and icon images are directly taken from "Slay the spire". Card art is made with the help of DALL-E.

The particular twist that I wanted to implement was to turn Slay the spire into an MMO card game where you battle enemies with your friends.

## Features

- **Deck-Building based Gameplay**
- **Party-System**
- **Chance based encounters**
- **MMO style progression**
- **Complex card synergies**

## Sample Code

_Client-side drag and drop system for cards_

```lua
function Drag(target)

end
```

## Challenges

- **UI** - Roblox's UI system is very limited and not designed for complex interfaces like card games. I had to come up with creative solutions to implement features like drag-and-drop, card previews, and dynamic layouts.
- **Multiplayer compatability**
