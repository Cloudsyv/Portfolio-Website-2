## Overview

This project was a complete overhaul of my original portfolio website. I wanted to create a more modern, responsive, and visually appealing site to showcase my projects and skills. It also provided me an excuse to learn React, NodeJS, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS.

## Key differences from the original portfolio / Features:

- **Improved Code structure**: The new portfolio has a much cleaner and more organized codebase thanks to React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, making it easier to maintain and update in the future.
- **Design**: The new design is more modern and visually appealing, with a moving background and improved layout.
- **Project Showcases**: Each project has its own dedicated page with detailed descriptions, images, and links to source code via MDX.
